Quick and dirty rake and XML tests. Very shoddy of me but I wrote no tests.
The basic idea is to output web pages based on a taxonomy and information about
objects in that taxonomy (e.g. destinations)

Would be a nice thing to generate from the taxonomy dynamically but this was only
a quick and dirty test, also would be worth executing through delayed
jobs (though the latter would require this actually having an app to live in)

Can be run with something like

rake destination_processor:process['~/taxonomy.xml','~/destinations.xml','~/output_directory']
